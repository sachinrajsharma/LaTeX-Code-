	The students of Class 12 were taken for an educational field trip to a technology park where they were shown how traffic speed sensors work. The instructor explained that these sensors detect the change in position of vehicles with respect to time and calculate speed using derivatives. Inspired by this, the students decided to model a problem in which a car moves along a straight road, and its position at time $t$ (in seconds) is given by the function $s(t) = 3t^3 - 6t^2 + 2t$ (in meters). They wanted to analyze the speed and acceleration of the car at different time intervals and determine when the car was at rest, speeding up, or slowing down. This application helped students link real-world motion with calculus concepts such as the first and second derivatives.
