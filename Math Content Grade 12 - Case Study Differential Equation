	\section*{Case Study 1}
	
	A pharmaceutical company is studying the change in concentration of a drug in the bloodstream. After a single injection, the rate at which the drug leaves the body is found to be proportional to the amount present at any time. Mathematically, this scenario is modeled using a first-order differential equation. If \( y(t) \) represents the concentration at time \( t \), then the equation takes the form:
	\[
	\frac{dy}{dt} = -ky, \quad k > 0
	\]
	This is a separable and linear differential equation. Its general solution is given by:
	\[
	y(t) = Ae^{-kt}
	\]
	where \( A \) is an arbitrary constant determined by initial conditions. The solution \( y(t) \) is called a general solution, while assigning a value to \( A \) based on an initial concentration leads to the particular solution. Such models are also used in radioactive decay, cooling laws, and financial depreciation problems. Understanding the difference between general and particular solutions is crucial in interpreting the practical implications of a differential equation.
