	Ananya was explaining to her younger brother how different types of numbers are represented on the number line. She marked numbers like $2$, $-3$, and $\dfrac{4}{5}$ and said these are rational numbers because they can be expressed as fractions. Then she tried to explain irrational numbers using $\sqrt{2}$ and $\pi$, which cannot be expressed as terminating or recurring decimals. She used a compass to show $\sqrt{2}$ on the number line by constructing a right-angled triangle with legs of 1 unit. Her brother asked, ``Can we place every number we know on the number line?''
